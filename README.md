# CGPA Calculator

This is a cgpa calculator app with features like 

* Firebase Auth Integration: Implemented Firebase Auth for secure authentication, ensuring that only authorized users could access the app. This was also to make sure nobody could just pick up your phone and check your cgpa

* Splash Screen Animation: Worked on animating the splash screen to create an engaging and visually appealing user experience.

* Offline Data Storage: Stored all grades data offline, providing users with the assurance that their data is safe and accessible even without an internet connection.

* Insights: Offered valuable insights based on the user's CGPA, such as academic insights, graduation eligibility, and a chart depicting GPA progression over time for a visual representation of progress.
